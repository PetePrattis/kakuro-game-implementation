# A Prolog Exercise / Project

**This is a Prolog project from my early days as a Computer Science student**

_This programm was created for the fifth semester class Logic Programming
and it is one of the final projects necessary to pass the class_

> #### Description of project
>
>>A script that implements a solution for the game Kakuro by assigning a variable to each empty square.

> #### Implementation of project
>
> 1. Define the line-2 predicate such that if a numeric list L sums to N and satisfies Kakuro's limit that  numbers 1, 2,. . . , 9 can only be displayed only once.
> 2. Define the solve-1 predicate that calculates a list that is the solution to the problem. That is, the list [A, B, C, E, ..., P] is a solution if all rows and columns meet the relevant conditions.
> 3. Define the solve-0 predicate that calculates and prints the list.

> #### About this project
>
> - The solution to the game Kakuro and extra information can be found at www.kakuro.net
> - The comments to make the code understandable, are within the .pl archive 
> - This repository was created to show the variety of the work I did and experience I gained as a student
